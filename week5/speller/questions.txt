0. What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
It is the longest word in the English language published in a dictionary.

1. According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
The getrusage() function returns information describing the resources utilized by the current process, or all its terminated child processes.

2. Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
There are 16 members are in a variable of type struct rusage.
struct rusage {
    struct timeval ru_utime; /* user time used */
    struct timeval ru_stime; /* system time used */
    long ru_maxrss;          /* max resident set size */
    long ru_ixrss;           /* integral shared text memory size */
    long ru_idrss;           /* integral unshared data size */
    long ru_isrss;           /* integral unshared stack size */
    long ru_minflt;          /* page reclaims */
    long ru_majflt;          /* page faults */
    long ru_nswap;           /* swaps */
    long ru_inblock;         /* block input operations */
    long ru_oublock;         /* block output operations */
    long ru_msgsnd;          /* messages sent */
    long ru_msgrcv;          /* messages received */
    long ru_nsignals;        /* signals received */
    long ru_nvcsw;           /* voluntary context switches */
    long ru_nivcsw;          /* involuntary context switches */
};

3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
In my opinion, in this case we pass before and after by reference for saveing memory usage.
If we pass variable by value to function, it will make a copy for each variable, it will also spend our memory space.

4. Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.
For loop fgetc until EOF, it mean loop will get file char one by one until `End Of File`.

In the loop, there have three condition section:
- Alphabetical characters and apostrophes (a-z and apostrophes)
Asign char to word[] array by index, then index plus 1 for next char come in, if index grather then LENGTH (string length limit), consume remainder char of current word and set index to zero for next .

- Numbers
If come in char is digit, consume remainder char of current word, then set index to zero.

- Not alphabetical characters and apostrophes and also not digit and index is not zero
It mean we already collect the char of currect word, set the end signal \0 to word[] array, words plus one, words will show later as `WORDS IN TEXT`, record resource and check spelled, if misspelled, show the misspelled words and misspellings plus one, it will show later as `WORDS MISSPELLED`, then finally, set index to zero and continue loop until EOF.

5. Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
We use fgetc function and check each char by self for make sure we have clear words for spelled checking, the fscanf function split and read string by `space`, `tab` and `\n` (next line signal), if we use fscanf function, we will get some string that we unnecessary to check.

6. Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
Becouse check and load parameters (word and dictionary) should never be changed.
